## some thoughts

i need to understand in depth how this works, apparently i added some security, but ...
on the post page, where part of the data is shown or hidden depending on the user is logged in,
I have this props thing with all the data that I am trying to hide.
then -> the approach needs to be done differently i think, this doesn't seem like the right way to do it.
